=== SIC Assembler Pass 2 Documentation ===

Much of the functionality remains the same between pass 1 and 2 with the exception that main.c
does an addition run through the .sic file using parse_line.c

parse_line.c has been updated with aditional logic to accept a flag identifying which pass logic
to use.  pass 2 skips adding symbols to the symbol table and instead references the symbol table
to construct object file using the new write_record.c function.

a MODTAB structure has been created to store modification records and is passed into a
print_mod_table function to print the mod records following the text records.
